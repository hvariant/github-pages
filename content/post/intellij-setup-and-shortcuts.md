Documenting my intellij setup to help setup Java development environment.

* Install intellij:
    Since the latest edition of intellij has an [annoying bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45244006/navigate-class-or-file-popup-closes-immediately-in-intellij-idea-2017-2/45244166#45244166) affecting action window focus,
    and none of the workarounds work (at least for me), downgrading is the easier option.

* Install ideaVim, set everything except the following to IDE command in 'Vim Emulation':
    - Ctrl+D
    - Ctrl+G
    - Ctrl+I
    - Ctrl+O
    - Ctrl+U
    - Ctrl+Close Bracket

There are a few useful shortcuts that are worth memorising:

* Ctrl+N/Ctrl+Shift+N/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N: action window for class, file, and symbol.

* Ctrl+Shift+F: find in path

* Esc to return focus to editor.

* Alt+Left/Right: switch between tabs

* Ctrl+F4: close tab

* Ctrl+Shift+O (custom): close others
